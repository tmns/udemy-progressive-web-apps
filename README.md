## Work from Udemy course "Progressive Web Apps (PWA) - The Complete Guide"

#### This repository hosts all my work completed while taking this udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/progressive-web-app-pwa-the-complete-guide/. 

#### Throughout the course you learn how to:

Build web apps that look and feel like native mobile apps for iOS and Android
Leverage device features like the camera and geolocation in your web apps
Use service workers to build web apps that work without internet connection (offline-first)
Use web push notifications to increase user engagement with your web apps
Use advanced service worker usage and caching strategies
Synchronize data in the background, even if connection is lost
Turn your next SPA project into a PWA

#### It's a great course and I highly recommend it!
